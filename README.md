# Mermaid Diagrams Repository

Welcome to the **Mermaid Diagrams Repository**! This repository is a treasure trove of Mermaid diagrams detailing various technical processes, from the intricate workings of compilers and Linux containers to the authentication flows in SAML and SSL. Each diagram is meticulously crafted to provide insights into complex systems through the simple, yet powerful, visual medium of Mermaid diagrams.

## How to Use

To view these diagrams, you'll need a Mermaid-compatible viewer or extension. Many code editors like Visual Studio Code have extensions for Mermaid, or you can use online tools like the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/).

Simply copy the content of a `.mermaid` file into your Mermaid viewer to render the diagram visually.
